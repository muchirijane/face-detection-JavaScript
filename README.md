# face-detection-JavaScript

This is an awesome project that uses Artificial intelligence and face recognition.
<br>
By accessing your webcam it is able to recognise your facial expression to determine your emotions,such as:
<ul>
  <li>Sad</li>
  <li>Happy</li>
  <li>Angry</li>
  <li>Neutral</li>
</ul>

PS: Run the code through a live server, if you have visual studio code that's even easier for you to use.ðŸ˜Ž
